# **Natural-Language-Processing**
The Basics of Natural Language Processing (NLP) repository on GitHub serves as a comprehensive learning resource for individuals interested in delving into the fundamental concepts of NLP. The repository covers a range of essential topics, providing a structured approach.

**Introduction to Regular Expressions:**
Learn the foundations of regular expressions, a powerful tool for text pattern matching and manipulation. Understand how to create and use regex patterns for text processing tasks.

**Text Preprocessing:**
Explore techniques for cleaning and preparing raw text data. This section covers tasks such as lowercasing, tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization, essential for optimizing text data for further analysis.

**Sentiment Analysis:**
Delve into sentiment analysis, a crucial application of NLP. Understand the basics of classifying text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments using various approaches, including rule-based and machine learning methods.

**Named Entity Recognition (NER):**
Learn about NER, a task that involves identifying and classifying entities (such as names of people, organizations, and locations) within text. Explore different NER techniques and tools.

**Bag of Words (BoW):**
Gain insights into the BoW model, a simple yet effective representation of text data. Understand how to convert text documents into numerical vectors, enabling the application of machine learning algorithms for various NLP tasks.

**TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency):**
Explore the TF-IDF representation, a statistical measure used to evaluate the importance of a word within a document relative to a collection of documents. Understand its significance in information retrieval and document similarity tasks.

**Word Embeddings:**
Dive into the world of word embeddings, which capture semantic relationships between words in a continuous vector space. Learn about popular embedding models like Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText, and understand their applications in NLP.
